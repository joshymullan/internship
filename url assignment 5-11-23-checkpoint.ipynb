If your booking includes minors, you have to email prior processing a reservation in order to confirm ages and provide written parental consent (if applicable), otherwise you will be refused the accommodation with no refunds (a partial voucher could be provided for a future stay). Any issue has to be addressed directly at Reception by the adult guests acting as guardians for the underline reservation.

We feature a mix of long term and leisure guests, this gives the ambience a uniquely quirky character, as a consequence it would be impossible to meet everybody\\'s taste. Discriminatory comments or behavior won\\'t be tolerated.\\n*Our 10 bed dorm can host up to 10 guests!
